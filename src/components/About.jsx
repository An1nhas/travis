        </div>
        <p>Travis Foundation is a non-profit organisation that digitises lesser-resourced languages, enabling communication for people in the most challenging circumstances. By compiling digital corpora, applying machine learning technology and collaborating on communication tools, we can help refugees, migrants and people in need communicate.</p>

            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>To bridge language barriers where itâ€™s needed most. We want to make communication a possibility in the most challenging circumstances, so that understanding, education and change can be achieved.</p>
            <br />
            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>We envisage a world where language hold no barriers. A world in which someone can visit a doctor, meet a lawyer or talk to a municipality and feel at ease. A world where direct communication exists between everyone, where everyone understands and can be understood.</p>
